A parameter has been added to provide this functionality. T o \nenable/disable this feature, refer to the information below.\nStart at PowerupWhen Start At Powerup in 2-wire control is configured, the drive starts if all start permissive conditions are met (within 10 seconds of drive power being applied), and the terminal block start input (Run, Run Forward or Run Reverse for 2-wire) \nis closed. An alarm is annunciated from application of power until the drive \nactually starts, indicating the powerup start attempt is in progress. \nThe powerup start attempt is aborted if any of the following occurs anytime \nduring the 10-second start interval:\n\u2022A fault condition occurs\n\u2022A Type 2 alarm condition occurs\n\u2022The terminal block programmed enable input is opened\n\u2022All terminal block run, run forward, or run reverse, inputs are canceled\n\u2022A Stop request (from any source) is received\nIf the drive has not started within the 10 second interval, the powerup start \nattempt is terminated.\nOverspeedOverspeed Limit is a user programmable value that enables operation at maximum speed, but also provides an overspeed band that enables a speed \nregulator, such as encoder feedback or slip compensation, to increase the output frequency above maximum speed to maintain maximum motor speed.\nThe figure below illustrates a typical custom V/Hz profile. Minimum speed is \nentered in Hertz and determines the lowe r speed reference limit during normal \noperation. Maximum speed is entered in Hertz and determines the upper speed \nreference limit.

This list \nincludes substantive updates only and is  not intended to reflect all changes. \nSafety\nThis device is intended to be part of the safety-related control system of a \nmachine.\nSafety Notes\nBefore installation, perform a risk assessment to determine whether the specifications of this device are suitable for all foreseeable operational and environmental characteristics of the machine to which it is to be fitted. At regular \nintervals during the life of the mach ine, check whether the characteristics \nforeseen remain valid.Rockwell Automation cannot accept responsi bility for failure of this device if the \nprocedures given in these instructions are not followed or if it is used outside the \nrecommended specifications in these instructions.\nRepair\nIf there is any malfunction or damage, do not attempt to repair. The unit must be \nreplaced before machine operation is allowed.\nFunctional Description\nThe unit is enabled once the supply is powered up and the safety circuits are \nclosed. The PWR status indicator is on.\nA valid reset operation activates the safety outputs. The CH1 and CH2 status \nindicators of the output illuminate. At the demand of the safety function and if any \nfault occurs, the safety outputs de-energize within the specified response time.\nFault Detection\nIf a fault occurs, the internal relay circuit fo rces the safety outputs off. One or both \noutput status indicators can be off. The PWR status indicator can flash. Remove \nthe fault and cycle the safety input to re-enable the device. Cycling power to the \nsafety relay can also clear the fault condition.Topic Page\nSummary of Changes 1Safety 1Repair 1Functional Description 1Specifications 2Diagnostics 2Safety Input 2Reset 2Installation 3Wiring Examples 3Circuit Diagram 3Approximate Dimensions 3Safety Specifications 4Declaration of Conformity 4\nTopic Page\nUpdated Declaration of Conformity 4\nATTENTION: Danger of serious injuries.\nMisuse can result in malfunction.\u2022 Only authorized and trained personnel must start up, \nassemble, install, manipulate , or retrofit the device.\n\u2022 Installation must be in accordance with these instructions.\u2022 Do not defeat, tamper, remove, or bypass this unit.IMPORTANT The safety inputs of these products are described as normally closed (N.C.), that is, with the guard closed, the \nactuator in place (where relevant) and the machine able to be started.

Accord ing to the wiring \ninputs, cross-loop monitoring of the inputs  is enabled or disabled. You can enable \ncross-loop monitoring for 2-channel safety  inputs in 4-wire connection (S11-S12, \nS21-S22). Cross-loop monitoring is disabled  for single-channel inputs, dual-channel \ninputs in 3-wire connection, and 24V DC signals. For external 24V DC signals, the negative pole must connect to S21.\nReset\n\u2022 Reset modes \u2014 The unit is available with automatic/manual start \n(MSR127T/TP safety relay) and ma nual monitored reset (MSR127R/RP \nsafety relay).\nA valid start/reset can only be operated if the feedback circuit is closed. \nFeedback contacts of controlled actuators are connected in series with the start/reset circuit (S12-S34).\n\u2022 T - Automatic/manual Start\nIn Automatic/Manual Start mode, the reset circuit S12-S34 is not \nmonitored against signal changes (no edge detection). The reset circuit \ncan close before or after the safety inputs are closed. The unit is active once the safety inputs close and th e reset circuit are closed. If the \nsafety inputs and reset circuit are co ncurrently closed during power-up, \nthe unit activates immediately.\n\u2022 R - Manual Monitored Reset\nIn Manual Monitored Reset mode, a si gnal change of the reset circuit \n(S33-S34) is required and monitored. A reset fault occurs if the safety \ninputs remain open while th e reset circuit is closed.\n- Positive edge:\nUnit is active once the safety in puts are closed and then the reset \ncircuit is closed.Attribute Value\nFunctional safety dataAccording to ISO 13849-1:\n\u2022P L e ,  C a t .  4\n\u2022M T T Fd [a]: 378\n\u2022 DC average: 99%\nAccording to IEC 62061 and IEC 61508:\n\u2022S I L  C L  3  \u2022 PFH [1/h]: 1.94E-09\n\u2022H F T :  1\n\u2022 DC: 99%\n\u2022 TM (PTI) [a]: 20\n\u2022 dop [d]/hop [h] (1): 365/24\n\u2022 tcycle [h]/[s] (2): 8/28,800\n(1) Operation time (day, hour)\n(2) Cycle time (hour, sec)Power supply24V AC/DC, 115V AC, 230V AC\n0.85\u20261.1 x rated voltage 50/60 Hz\nPower consumption 2 W\nSafety inputs 1 N.C., 2 N.C., 2 PNP light curtain\nInput simultaneity InfiniteAllowable input resistance, max 110 \u03a9\nReset Manual monitored and automatic/manual\nOutputsMSR127RP/TP 3 N.O. safety, 1 N.C. auxiliary\nMSR127.1T 2 N.O. safety, 2 N.O. auxiliary\nOutput rating\u2022U L :  B 3 0 0\n5 A/240V AC\n\u2022A C - 1 5 :  5  A / 2 5 0 V  A C\u2022D C - 1 3 :  3  A / 2 4 V  D C\nFuses output (external) 6 A slow blow or 10 A quick blowSwitched current/voltage, min 10 mA/10 V\nContact material AgSnO\n2 + 0.5\u00b5Au\nElectrical life (operations)\u2022 100,000 (220V AC/4 A/880VA cos \u03c6 = 0.35)\n\u2022 500,000 (220V AC/1.7 A/375VA cos \u03c6 = 0.6)\n\u2022 1,000,000 (30V DC/2 A/60 W)\n\u2022 2,000,000 (10V DC/0.01 A/0.1 W)\nMechanical life 10,000,000 cycles\nPower on delay 1 sResponse time 15 ms\nRecovery time 100 ms\nImpulse withstand voltage 2500VPollution degree 2\nInstallation group Overvoltage category III, VDE 0110-1\nOperating temperature -5\u2026+55 \u00b0C (23\u2026131 \u00b0F)Relative humidity 90%\nEnclosure protection IP40 (NEMA 1)\nTerminal protection IP20Wiring Use copper that withstands 60/75 \u00b0C (140/167 \u00b0F)\nConductor size 0.2\u20262.5 mm\u00b2 (24\u202612 AWG)\nTorque settings - terminal screws 0.6\u20260.8 N\u2022m (5\u20267 lb\u2022in)\nCase material Polyamide PA 6.6\nMounting35 mm (1.4 in.)
